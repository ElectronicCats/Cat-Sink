# CatSink - USB power supply with PD

A USB-C PD Sink up to 20V 5A based on the Cypress CYPD3177 USB PD Controller

USB-C PD offers the option to negotiate power delivery from a compatible power supply. This board plays the role of a sink device, enabling any device to be powered from a USB power supply. Any type of power connector can be attached through a 2-pin screw terminal or directly soldered into the PCB for a lower profile. The voltage can be set to 5V, 9V, 12V, or 20V and maximum negotiable current can be set to 1A, 2A, 3A, or 5A. Other voltage or current settings are possible by changing resistors. No programming needed.
